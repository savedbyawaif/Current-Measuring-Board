This is an onboarding project I worked on for the University of Alberta EcoCar team.
The task is as follows:
"Design a current measuring board. This board will need to use a ATmega328P
microcontroller (same one used on Arduino UNO), to measure the current. The board
will be connected inline with the cable in which we are measuring the current. It will use
a hall current sensor (Allegro ACS723) to measure the current. The board will be
powered off a 9V battery, so a switching DC/DC regulator will be required to drop the
voltage from 9V to 5V, which the microcontroller requires. The board should have an
LCD or a 7-segment display which displays the current. The board should also have
USB functionality (enabled via wiring a USB to serial/TTL connector)."
